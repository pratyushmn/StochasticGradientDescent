# StochasticGradientDescent
My implementation of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, tested out on a simple linear regression model.

## Description:
I used Pytorch as well as numpy and pandas to solve a basic linear regression problem using my own implementation of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, as defined by Google [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/reducing-loss/stochastic-gradient-descent).

The dataset was found on Kaggle, and can be accessed at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/venjktry/simple-linear-regression).
